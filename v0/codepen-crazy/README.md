## Codepen Crazy
### Instructions
1. Find a fun/interesting/engaging Codepen that uses HTML, CSS (not Sass) and Javascript.
2. Create a valid `index.html` file, in a new project folder.
3. Copy the code from the HTML panel of your chosen Codepen and paste it inside the `body` element.
4. Copy the code from the CSS panel and paste it into `css/main.css` in the root of your project directory
5. Link your external style sheet (using the `link` element) in the `head` of `index.html`.
6. If neccessary: Copy the code from the JS panel and paste it into `js/app.js` in the root of your project directory.
7. Link your external Javascript file (using a `script` element) just above the closing `body` tag (`</body>`) in `index.html`.
8. Test your new page in Live Server (or just open `index.html` in your browser).
